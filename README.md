2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   A challenge that I encountered while I was creating this submission was that the sounds from the buttons weren't automatically played when pressed.
   Initially, I assumed that there was a bug in my project; however, when I attempted to retrace my steps, I realized that I couldn't pinpoint the issue.
   Afterward, I tried rewriting the functions hoping that the error was related to a syntax issue I possibly made while following the instructions.
   When I tried the buttons again, they finally worked. Another slight challenge that I encountered was switching between HTML, JavaScript, and CSS programming styles.
   Since the programming styles are different, there would be instances where I would program using a different syntax which would create errors in my code.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   The questions that I have about web development primarily correspond to the opportunities or capabilities of the following programming languages JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
   Based on the description that was provided for us in the instructions, it was interesting to learn that each language can be used for specific functions.
   My question is that were web development programming languages created with the purpose of being used alongside other languages?
   Also, is it possible to solely rely on one web development programming language to fulfill every task that is needed?

4) If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would complete some of the optional features given to us to make the version of the website more advanced.
   Also, I would want to change the position of the buttons on the site to remain centered rather than constantly changing to fit the screen size.
   I would also like to change how some of the features are presented, maybe include some graphics, such as pictures or page borders.
   Another feature that I would like to implement would be to add snippets of popular songs to buttons so that once they are pressed, a popular harmony or melody would play.
   Another feature that would be fun to implement would be if the user could choose before each game the music genre they would like to play with, like Gospel, Rock, Classical, Rhythm and blues, etc.
   Therefore, based on their genre selection, different types of popular songs would play.
   This would be an exciting feature because it can add a fun element to the web page.
